    1. In working with the message store, it is absolutely critical to pay attention
        to the postgres fields when return the records, as a single error when reading
        the last message (e.g.
            globalPosition: parseInt(rawMessage.globalPosition,10), >>> the wrong one
            globalPosition: parseInt(rawMessage.global_position,10)) >>> the right one)
        will render the whole app useless.
