Lessons learned:

    1. If you start adding typescript, you'll have to add types into a types.d.ts file in the same path as the *.ts file.
     In such a case, you need to do in your main *.ts file:
        import { IDomainInterface} from './types';

    2. If ESLint is giving an error when you compile tsc:
        ESLint: Require statement not part of import statement
       Solution:
        Add to your .eslintrc.json file:
        "rules": {
                "@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires": 0}

    3. If git comes back with an error:
            error: short read while indexing node_modules/lodash/fp/toJSON.js
    then restart the docker postgres databases:
            docker-compose rm && docker-compose up
