Lessons learned:

    1. 1. When you have to pay tech debt in terms of skipped tests, be sure you zoom in on the
        failing test. For ex., assume that you remove the .skip, so assume you'll get
        5 failing tests in different parts of the app.
            Step 1. Find the first failing test in the list into your test  files;
            Step 2. Run "jest --config jest.unit.config.js $MY_FIRST_FAILING_TEST_PATH"
            Step 3. Make that failing test a .only test;
            Step 4. Solve that test;
            Step 5. Once solved, go back to the "npm run test:unit" command and reapply the procedure
                for each of the remaining tests in the set;
                Obs. Don't forget to git add/ git commit in the intermediate steps
