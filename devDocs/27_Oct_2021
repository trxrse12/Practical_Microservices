Lessons learned:
        1. In TS, is not easy to model a null function: () => {};
            Solution:
                type NullFunctionResult = {};
                type NullFunction = () => {};
                const fcn = () => ({} as NullFunctionResult);

        2. I learned how to type a rest tuple used as args in an async function:
                export type QueryParams = [
                  streamName: StreamName,
                  fromPosition: number,
                  maxMessages: number
                ];

                const fakeDb = {
                    query: async (...[streamName, fromPosition, maxMessages]: QueryParams) => {
